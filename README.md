🧠 Quantum Superposition Demo — Hadamard Gate Project

📘 Overview

This project demonstrates quantum superposition using Qiskit.
A single qubit is initialized in state |0⟩, transformed by a Hadamard gate (H) into a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩, then measured using a quantum simulator.

It visually shows how quantum states behave using the Bloch sphere and measurement histograms.

🧩 Concept

The Hadamard gate creates superposition:

|ψ⟩ = \frac{|0⟩ + |1⟩}{\sqrt{2}}

Repeated measurements show roughly 50% 0s and 50% 1s, proving quantum probability.

🧮 Output Example

Measurement Results:
{'0': 503, '1': 497}

Each run gives a slightly different ratio due to quantum randomness.
